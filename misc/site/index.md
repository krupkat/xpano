Tool for stitching photos with focus on simplicity and ease of use.

After you import your images, the app auto detects groups of images to stitch into panoramas. You can then check the panorama previews and run export to save the full resolution results.

## Demo

Check out the app in action on [YouTube](https://youtu.be/-TuKaO9gxsU).

This is how the app looks after importing a directory of 200 images.

## Built with
